Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = 'abcabcbb'<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: The answer is 'abc', with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = 'bbbbb'<br>
Output = 1<br>
Explanation: The answer is 'b', with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = 'pwwkew'<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: The answer is 'wke', with the length of 3.<br>
Notice that the answer must be a substring, 'pwke' is a subsequence and not a substring.

Example 4:

Input: s = ''<br>
Output: 0

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10⁴
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
