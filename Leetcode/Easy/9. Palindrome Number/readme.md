Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Follow up**: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

**Example 1**:

>Input: x = 121<br>
Output: true

**Example 2**:

>Input: x = -121<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3**:

>Input: x = 10<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 4**:

>Input: x = -101<br>
Output: false

**Constraints**:

- -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
